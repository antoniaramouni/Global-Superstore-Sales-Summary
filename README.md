In this project, I used PowerBI to create a report where I can get sales insights.
I imported the data from excel "global_superstore_2016", my data is for 4 years from 2012 till 2015, and I wanted to compare using the slicers all these years plus to the average.
I used Power Query, in order to add some columns like "Year" also the add the "$" next to the amounts in order to know which currency we are using and other 
modifications using power querry. Plus, I used different visualization models for different reasons, like pie chart, donnut chart, histogram, filled map, cards and slicers.
I will explain more the steps in the meeting. 
Hope you will like it!
